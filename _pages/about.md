<!-- Write some random text here.
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello, I'm a researcher with a keen interest in the creative and technical realms, especially where they intersect in interactive computer graphics and extended reality. My goal is to explore and expand human experiences through these innovative mediums. My passion for immersive technology drives me to discover new ways to connect and engage with the world, blurring the lines between the virtual and the real.

 I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Houston, TX, USA. My journey also includes over 3 years of professional experience in the training and simulation industry as an Engineer, following my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka.
