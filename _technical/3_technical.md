    3D data visualization transforms comprehension,
offering a richer understanding of complex structures and
volumetric information. This project addresses the challenge
of comprehending intricate 3D volumetric data on traditional
2D displays by leveraging Virtual Reality (VR) technology. Our
approach tackles the challenge by implementing the raymarching
algorithm using HLSL and C++, coupled with VR development
in the Unreal Engine framework. We successfully integrated
the raymarching algorithm, HLSL, and C++ within Unreal
Engine. Furthermore, our VR-based application includes the
implementation of interactive color transfer functions, enabling
real-time customization for a more adaptive and user-centric
visualization experience. The incorporation of the raymarching
algorithm captures intricate self-shadowing details, showcasing
a great rendering technique. Additionally, our implementation
of interactive color transfer functions introduces dynamic ad-
justments, providing users with unprecedented insights and
underscoring the impact of our approach in immersive data
visualization.
