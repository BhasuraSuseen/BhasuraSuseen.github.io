        3D data visualization transforms comprehension,
    offering a richer understanding of complex structures and
    volumetric information. This project addresses the challenge
    of comprehending intricate 3D volumetric data on traditional
    2D displays by leveraging Virtual Reality (VR) technology. Our
    approach tackles the challenge by implementing the raymarching
    algorithm using HLSL and C++, coupled with VR development
    in the Unreal Engine framework. We successfully integrated
    the raymarching algorithm, HLSL, and C++ within Unreal
    Engine. Furthermore, our VR-based application includes the
    implementation of interactive color transfer functions, enabling
    real-time customization for a more adaptive and user-centric
    visualization experience. The incorporation of the raymarching
    algorithm captures intricate self-shadowing details, showcasing
    a great rendering technique. Additionally, our implementation
    of interactive color transfer functions introduces dynamic ad-
    justments, providing users with unprecedented insights and
    underscoring the impact of our approach in immersive data
    visualization.
