        I was one of the first five team members who contributed to the development of the SAF-TAC Minimum Viable Product. From there, the team expanded to over 20 people with new components and features. Below are some of my significant contributions. <br>

        ● Contributed to the development of map and content modding infrastructure.<br>
        ● Contributed to iterative development of hybrid (animation and IK driven) 3 point tracked full-body VR
        avatar system.<br>
        ● Developed 3D interaction systems and 3D user interfaces for VR users.<br>
        ● Developed 3D/2D scenario authoring/replay tools and user interfaces.<br>
        ● Developed camera, navigation and switching systems for vehicles and characters.<br>
        ● Developed time of the day and weather control features.<br>
        ● Research and development to automate geo-specific terrain generation.<br>
        ● Created dynamic paths(aircraft and projectile) and shapes drawing plugin.<br>
        ● Initiated profiling and optimization processes and multiplayer replication best practices to improve
        performance and increasing concurrent player count.<br>
        ● Integrated in-house haptic suit and ProTubeVR haptic weapon.<br>
        ● Carried out logic/content optimizations and configurations to support multiple VR devices (Oculus
        Rift/Rifts, Oculus Quest, Samsung Odyssey, HTC Vive)</p>
