        VR/Desktop multiplayer application designed specifically for military simulation and training with essential simulation functions such as Exercise Control, Scenario Authoring and After-Action Review.
        ● Contributed to the development of map and content modding infrastructure.
        ● Contributed to iterative development of hybrid (animation and IK driven) 3 point tracked full-body VR
        avatar system.
        ● Developed 3D interaction systems and 3D user interfaces for VR users.
        ● Developed 3D/2D scenario authoring/replay tools and user interfaces.
        ● Developed camera, navigation and switching systems for vehicles and characters.
        ● Developed time of the day and weather control features.
        ● Research and development to automate geo-specific terrain generation.
        ● Created dynamic paths(aircraft and projectile) and shapes drawing plugin.
        ● Initiated profiling and optimization processes and multiplayer replication best practices to improve
        performance and increasing concurrent player count.
        ● Integrated in-house haptic suit and ProTubeVR haptic weapon.
        ● Carried out logic/content optimizations and configurations to support multiple VR devices (Oculus
        Rift/Rifts, Oculus Quest, Samsung Odyssey, HTC Vive)</p>
