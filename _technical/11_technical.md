        <p>A group of you end up trapped in an ice cave while on a trek. You must use resources in the cave to craft parts of a tower to leave the cave by using creators in the cave. But unbeknownst to the rest of you one of the members of your group has been replaced by ‘The Frozen’, an ancient being that resides in the cave. You may not be able to trust each other but must work together in order to complete the tower and leave before ‘The Frozen’ claims you. The closer you get to completing the tower the more desperate ‘The Frozen’ will become and reveal its true nature, and its desire to have you all you remain here forever Under the Ice. </p>

        Gameplay 
        <br>
        Requires at least 3 players to get the proper experience of the game. Having a method of communication between the players such as VoIP will be necessary as there is no in-game communication implemented in this version. 
        Once the match starts one player will be randomly assigned 'The Frozen' - That player’s objective is to prevent the others from completing the tower before time runs out
        Victims must gather resources by attacking various objects in the map. These dropped resources must be taken to one of the six magical generators to create a piece of the escape tower, color of that effect corresponds to the magical generator that creates the next piece required by the tower.
