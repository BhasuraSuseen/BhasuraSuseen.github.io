        Game of Thoughts is a two player turn based game. Inspired by the well known theory, "Game of Life", we built a whole new concept for gaming by mixing strategy, adventure, puzzles and action, providing something for every type of gamer.<br>

        Game of Thoughts is proven to be addictive and eye catching because of the carefully chosen graphics and storyÂ­line. Not just playing it, simply developing this game was an enjoyable experience.
