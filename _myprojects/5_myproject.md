    In a captivating narrative, a man invites his friend over to his apartment, setting the stage for an evening that defies the ordinary. Their conversation soon spirals into a deep philosophical debate about the subjective nature of right and wrong, challenging the very foundations of morality and perception. As the discussion intensifies, the protagonist shares a chilling story about another friend who mysteriously vanished into thin air in a similar setting. Adding an otherworldly dimension to the tale, the protagonist begins to sing in an incomprehensible gibberish language, urging his friend to join in this bizarre yet strangely connective act. The story reaches its climax when, in a stunning twist, the protagonist himself suddenly disappears into thin air, leaving his friend alone in the apartment, enveloped in a surreal mix of confusion, wonder, and existential contemplation. <br>
    Who is the protagonist now?
