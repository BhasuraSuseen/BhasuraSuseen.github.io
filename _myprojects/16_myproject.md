        This theater play structured as a series of interconnected short stories, woven together to guide an "Romenthe" event. Each story, set against the backdrop of a hike to Romantic Mountain, focuses on different groups of university students. These tales are skillfully interlaced with the main event, transitioning smoothly from one story to another, providing both entertainment and narrative continuity.

        The play begins with the first group embarking on their journey, filled with excitement and anticipation. As they pass through a peculiar village, they encounter unique characters, setting the tone for the adventures ahead. Each subsequent story introduces a new set of students, each facing their own challenges and mysteries on the mountain.

        Themes of friendship, bravery, and self-exploration are explored through these diverse narratives. The stories are both humorous and poignant, capturing the essence of youthful adventure and the complexities of human relationships.

        As the event progresses, the audience is drawn deeper into the world of Romantic Mountain, with each story adding a new layer to the overarching narrative. The play culminates in a grand finale that brings all the characters together, revealing the interconnectedness of their experiences.
