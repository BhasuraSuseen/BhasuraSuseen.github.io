        In this game, you start by meeting baby John, who initially knows only two emotions: laugh and cry. Your task is to tap icons to keep John happy. However, as the game progresses and John grows, his emotions and responses become more complex. You will witness the development of his unique character traits and must adapt your actions to make him laugh as you progress through levels. Each level is timed, and if you fail to make John laugh within the allotted time, he will cry out loud.
